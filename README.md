# Real-world Time to Treatment Discontinuation Prediction

This is the code repository for Real-world Time to Treatment Discontinuation Prediction research project. The code reproduces the result in the paper "A machine learning approach to real-world time to treatment discontinuation prediction" accepted in the Journal of Advanced Intelligent Systems. https://doi.org/10.22541/au.166065465.59798123/v1

## 3 Running the code
In each of the above subdirectory, there is a base directory and a simulate_all.sh file.
The base directory contains the basic code to test each of the above parameters.
The simulate_all.sh file is the executable that test over a bunch of parameters.
Under each base directory:
|_ simulate.py # simulate the data that follows the distribution to be tested.
    when testing with your own data, please replace the datamatrix from simulate.py
|_ bash.sh # runs through a single cross-validation fold
|_ bash_all.sh # runs through five cross-validations
|_ python3 split.py # split data set into train and test
|_ guanrank.pl # calculate the ranking value in training set
|_ guanrank_time.pl # calculate the future time value for each ranked value
|_ prepare_train.pl # prepare training dataset, test dataset and validation dataset using the estimated future time
|_ train.py # train and interpolate prediction results
